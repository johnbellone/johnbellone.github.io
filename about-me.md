# About Me
I am the team lead of Platform Engineering at [Bloomberg][0]. My team
is busy leading the charge of developing a culture of DevOps and
building reusable infrastructure with [Chef][1]. I pride myself in being a
polyglot hacker; Bloomberg isn't the place for titles, but over the
plast few years I have held pleasure of wearing many hats:

- Senior Software Engineer at [Bloomberg Derivatives][2] (New York, N.Y.)
- Senior Software Engineer at [Bloomberg Government][3] (Washington D.C.)
- Infrastructure Engineer at [Bloomberg Government][3] (Washington D.C.)
- Team Lead of Bloomberg Web Operations (Washington D.C.)

Prior to my tenure at Bloomberg I ran a startup straight out of
college with [a couple of awesome cats][4], was the editor-in-chef of
my university's weekly newspaper and was a contractor at
[Citigroup's][5] high-frequency trading division. I am a
technologist and have shipped software written in Fortran, C/C++,
Python, Ruby Java, C#, Go and much, much more.

As you can tell my hobbies include a lot of technology. I contribute
to open source on [GitHub][6]. I enjoy traveling, hiking and riding my
motorcycle like I stole it. You can sometimes find me trading quips on
[Twitter][7]. I am a writer, reader and a fan of whiskey on the rocks. More
recently a drinker of old fashions.
