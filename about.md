![Me](/public/img/duct_tape.png)

I am currently the team lead of the Platform Engineering team at
[Bloomberg][1]. I pride myself in being a polyglot hacker; Bloomberg
isn't the place for titles, but over the past few years I have held
the following roles:

* Team Lead of R&D Platform Engineering (Washington D.C.);
* Team Lead of R&D Web Operations (Washington D.C.);
* Infrastructure Lead at R&D Bloomberg Government (Washington D.C.);
* Senior Software Engineer of R&D Bloomberg Government (Washington D.C.);
* Senior Software Engineer of R&D Bloomberg Derivatives (New York N.Y.);

Prior to my tenure at Bloomberg I ran a startup straight out of
college with a [couple of awesome cats][2], was the editor-in-chef of
my university's weekly newspaper and was a contractor at
[Citigroup's][3] High Frequency trading department. I am a
technologist and have shipped software written in Fortran, C/C++,
Python, Ruby Java, C#, Go and much, much more.

As you can tell my hobbies include a lot of technology. I contribute
to open source on [GitHub][4]. I enjoy traveling, hiking and riding my
motorcycle like I stole it. You can sometimes find me trading quips on
[Twitter][5] and on [Google+][6]. I am a writer, reader and a fan of
whiskey on the rocks. More recently a drinker of old fashions.
