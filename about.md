![Me](/public/img/duct_tape.png)

I am the team lead of Platform Engineering at [Bloomberg][1].

I pride myself in being a polyglot hacker; Bloomberg isn't the place for
titles, but over the plast few years I have held pleasure of wearing
many hats:

- Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg Derivatives (New York, N.Y.)
- Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg Government (Washington D.C.)
- Infrastructure Engineer at Bloomberg Government (Washington D.C.)
- Team Lead of Bloomberg Web Operations (Washington D.C.)

Prior to my tenure at Bloomberg I ran a startup straight out of college
with a [couple of awesome cats][2], was the editor-in-chef of my
university's weekly newspaper and was a contractor at [Citigroup's][3]
High Frequency trading department. I am a technologist and have shipped
software written in Fortran, C/C++, Python, Ruby Java, C#, Go and
much, much more.

As you can tell my hobbies include a lot of technology. I contribute
to open source on [GitHub][4]. I enjoy traveling, hiking and riding
my motorcycle like I stole it. You can sometimes find me trading
quips on [Twitter][5] and on [Google+][6]. I am a writer, reader
and a fan of whiskey on the rocks. More recently a drinker of old
fashions.
